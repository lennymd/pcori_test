For example, if the PCP ordered additional tests or specialist referrals, the navigators assisted in scheduling these additional appointments, phoned patients to remind them, identified and addressed any barriers such as transportation, and encouraged patients to follow PCP recommendations. When needed, navigators helped patients to access medical transportation assistance through the state Medicaid system.
