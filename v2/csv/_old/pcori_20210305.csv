Clinical-community collaborations could help mitigate such risk. We sought to design, implement, refine, and evaluate Keeping Infants Nourished and Developing (KIND), a collaborative intervention focused on food-insecure families with infants. METHODS: Pediatricians and community collaborators codeveloped processes to link food-insecure families with infants to supplementary infant formula, educational materials, and clinic and community resources. Intervention evaluation was done prospectively by using time-series analysis and descriptive statistics to characterize and enumerate those served by KIND during its first 2 years. Analyses assessed demographic, clinical, and social risk outcomes, including completion of preventive services and referral to social work or our medical-legal partnership. Comparisons were made between those receiving and not receiving KIND by using chi2 statistics. RESULTS: During the 2-year study period, 1042 families with infants received KIND. Recipients were more likely than nonrecipients to have completed a lead test and developmental screen (both P < .001), and they were more likely to have received a full set of well-infant visits by 14 months (42.0% vs. 28.7%; P < .0001). Those receiving KIND also were significantly more likely to have been referred to social work (29.2% vs. 17.6%; P < .0001) or the medical-legal partnership (14.8% vs. 5.7%; P < .0001). Weight-for-length at 9 months did not statistically differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: A clinical-community collaborative enabled pediatric providers to address influential social determinants of health.

METHODS: A total of 112 violently injured youth (ages 12-20 years; 80% male; predominantly African-American [60%] and Latino [26%]) hospitalized in Oakland, California participated in a retrospective case-control study. Clients were matched by age and injury severity. Treatment and control youth were followed for 6 months after their individual dates of injury. The outcome variables of rate of entry/reentry into the criminal justice system, rate of rehospitalization for violent injuries and rate of violence-related deaths were compared for treatment and control groups using an odds ratio analysis. RESULTS: Intervention youth were 70% less likely to be arrested for any offense (odds ratio [OR] = 0.257) and 60% less likely to have any criminal involvement (OR = 0.356) when compared with controls. No statistically significant differences were found for rates of reinjury or death.

To address this, we created the Highland Health Advocates (HHA), an ED-based help desk and medical-legal partnership using undergraduate volunteers to help patients navigate public resources and provide onsite legal and social work referrals. We were able to provide these services in English and Spanish. We aimed to determine the social needs of the patients who presented to our ED and the potential impact of the programme in resolving those needs and connecting them to a 'medical home' (defined as a consistent, primary source of medical care such as a primary care doctor or clinic). METHODS: ED patients at a US safety net hospital were enrolled in a 1:2 ratio in a quasi-experiment comparing those who received intervention from the HHA during a limited access rollout with controls who received usual care on days with no help desk. We collected a baseline social needs evaluation, with follow-up assessments at 1 and 6 months. Primary outcomes were linkages for the primary identified need and to a medical home within 1month. Other outcomes at 6 months included whether a patient (1) felt helped; 2) had a decreased number of ED visits; (3) had the primary identified need met; (4) had a primary doctor; and (5) had a change in self-reported health status. RESULTS: We enrolled 459 subjects (intervention=154, control=305). Housing (41%), employment (23%) and inability to pay bills (22%) were participants' top identified needs. At baseline, 32% reported the ED as their medical home, with the intervention cohort having higher ED utilisation (>1 ED visit in the prior month: 49% vs 24%). At 1month, 185 (40%) subjects were reached for follow-up, with more HHA subjects linked to a resource (59% vs 37%) and a medical home (92% vs 76%). At 6 months, 75% of subjects felt HHA was helpful and more subjects in the HHA group had a doctor (93% v 69%). No difference was found in ED utilisation, primary need resolution or self-reported health status. CONCLUSIONS: Health-related social needs are common in this US safety net ED.

SUBJECTS: Women were previously recruited for a randomized controlled trial of the home visiting model disseminated as Nurse-Family Partnership. 512 of these women had second children within 18 years of the first child's birth, and were included in our sample. RESULTS: The intervention was associated with a lower likelihood of low birthweight for second children (odds ratio: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.97), an effect apparent only if the first-born had low birthweight and mediated by close birth spacing. These moderation and mediation patterns were similar in the preterm birth outcome.

Methods Study eligibility criteria: ages 3-19 years, A1C >=8.5% (>=69 mmol/mol) and/or recent diabetic ketoacidosis hospitalization, type 1 diabetes duration >=1 year, and English- or Spanish-speaking. Eighty-nine youth and their caregivers participated in the 9- to 12-month intervention, which included diabetes education and support through 3 home visits, 1 to 2 school visits, and phone support from a lay health worker, as well as legal support from a medical-legal partnership attorney. Feasibility was assessed; change in A1C was compared in a linear mixed model. Results Of the 89 DCCA Program participants, 80% completed the program, with the majority of participants rating their DCCA favorably. Sixty-two percent reported >=1 unmet legal need, of whom 29% accepted legal counsel. Youth enrolled in the DCCA Program demonstrated an improvement in glycemic control as their mean A1C decreased from 9.71% (83 mmol/mol) at the start of the program to 9.40% (79 mmol/mol) at the end of the intervention period ( P = .03). Participants with public health insurance experienced the greatest differential A1C reduction (9.79% to 9.11%, 83 mmol/mol to 76 mmol/mol). Conclusions The DCCA Program represents a promising intervention for improving care of high-risk youth with type 1 diabetes. A significant proportion of caregivers of youth reported having an unmet legal need.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate association of a ""Housing First"" intervention for chronically homeless individuals with severe alcohol problems with health care use and costs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Quasi-experimental design comparing 95 housed participants (with drinking permitted) with 39 wait-list control participants enrolled between November 2005 and March 2007 in Seattle, Washington. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Use and cost of services (jail bookings, days incarcerated, shelter and sobering center use, hospital-based medical services, publicly funded alcohol and drug detoxification and treatment, emergency medical services, and Medicaid-funded services) for Housing First participants relative to wait-list controls. RESULTS: Housing First participants had total costs of $8,175,922 in the year prior to the study, or median costs of $4066 per person per month (interquartile range [IQR], $2067-$8264). Median monthly costs decreased to $1492 (IQR, $337-$5709) and $958 (IQR, $98-$3200) after 6 and 12 months in housing, respectively. Poisson generalized estimating equation regressions using propensity score adjustments showed total cost rate reduction of 53% for housed participants relative to wait-list controls (rate ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.88) over the first 6 months. Total cost offsets for Housing First participants relative to controls averaged $2449 per person per month after accounting for housing program costs. CONCLUSIONS: In this population of chronically homeless individuals with high service use and costs, a Housing First program was associated with a relative decrease in costs after 6 months.

A special program of outreach services was designed as the principal means to achieve this goal. This study was made to determine the effects of these outreach services on (1) the use of or nonuse of ambulatory care services; (2) the volume and type of services used; (3) the patterns of use; and (4) the appointment-keeping behavior of the project population for a 12-month period. Outreach and medical care services were provided to an average of 7,000 persons in 1,500 low-income families who were enrolled as health plan members in the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Care Program. Project participants were randomly divided into two groups, one with and one without services, and utilization data were collected from their medical and administrative records. The findings suggest that outreach intervention had a positive effect on access to care. Persons who received outreach services were more likely to contact the medical care system; these persons also showed a substantial difference in the volume of services they used, when compared to those without outreach services. Outreach workers were less successful in changing utilization patterns, although slight differences were found in the direction of more appropriate use. Persons with outreach services were more likely to have made contacts with their regular physician, to have made a smaller proportion of walk-in contacts, to have had a higher proportion of regularly scheduled contacts, and to have made a higher proportion of continuing visits.

DATA SOURCES: Multiple administrative data from New York City and New York State for 966 heads of families eligible for the program during 2007-12. STUDY DESIGN: We captured housing events and health care service utilization during 2 years prior to the first program eligibility date (baseline) and 2 years postbaseline. We performed sequence analysis to measure housing stability and compared housing stability and preventable ED visits and hospitalizations between program participants (treatment group) and eligible applicants not placed in the program (comparison group) via marginal structural modeling. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: We matched electronically collected data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Eighty-seven percent of supportive housing tenants experienced housing stability in 2 years postbaseline. Compared with unstably housed heads of families in the comparison group, those in the treatment group were 0.60 times as likely to make preventable ED visits postbaseline (95% CI = 0.38, 0.96).

METHODS: We investigated respite care's impact on 225 hospitalized homeless adults consecutively referred from an urban public hospital during a 26-month period. The cohort was separated into 2 groups: (1) patients referred and accepted into the respite center and (2) patients referred but denied admission because beds were unavailable. All patients met the center's predefined eligibility criteria. Main outcome measures were inpatient days, emergency department visits, and outpatient clinic visits. RESULTS: The 2 groups had similar demographic characteristics, admitting diagnoses, and patterns of medical care use at baseline.

Objective: To determine whether participation in a medically tailored meal intervention is associated with fewer subsequent hospitalizations. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using near/far matching instrumental variable analysis. Data from the 2011-2015 Massachusetts All-Payer Claims database and Community Servings, a not-for-profit organization delivering medically tailored meals (MTMs), were linked. The study was conducted from December 15, 2016, to January 16, 2019. Recipients of MTMs who had at least 360 days of preintervention claims data were matched to nonrecipients on the basis of demographic, clinical, and neighborhood characteristics. Interventions: Weekly delivery of 10 ready-to-consume meals tailored to the specific medical needs of the individual under the supervision of a registered dietitian nutritionist. Main Outcomes and Measures: Inpatient admissions were the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were admission to a skilled nursing facility and health care costs (from medical and pharmaceutical claims). Results: There were 807 eligible MTM recipients. After matching, there were 499 MTM recipients, matched to 521 nonrecipients for a total of 1020 study participants (mean [SD] age, 52.7 [14.5] years; 568 [55.7%] female). Prior to matching and compared with nonrecipients in the same area, health care use, health care cost, and comorbidity were all significantly higher in recipients. For example, preintervention mean (SD) inpatient admissions were 1.6 (6.5) in MTM recipients vs 0.2 (0.8) in nonrecipients (P < .001), and mean health care costs were $80617 ($312337) vs $16138 ($68738) (P < .001). Recipients compared with nonrecipients were also significantly more likely to have HIV (21.9% vs 0.7%, P < .001), cancer (37.9% vs 11.3%, P < .001), and diabetes (33.7% vs 7.0%, P < .001). In instrumental variable analyses, MTM receipt was associated with significantly fewer inpatient admissions (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.22-0.80; risk difference, -519; 95% CI, -360 to -678 per 1000 person-years). Similarly, MTM receipt was associated with fewer skilled nursing facility admissions (IRR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.01-0.60; risk difference, -913; 95% CI, -689 to -1457 per 1000 person-years). The models estimated that, had everyone in the matched cohort received treatment owing to the instrument (and including the cost of program participation), mean monthly costs would have been $3838 vs $4591 if no one had received treatment owing to the instrument (difference, -$753; 95% CI, -$1225 to -$280). Conclusions and Relevance: Participation in a medically tailored meals program appears to be associated with fewer hospital and skilled nursing admissions and less overall medical spending.",31009050,JAMA internal medicine,"Division of General Medicine and Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine.

We examined a nonprofit, community-based program in Queens, New York, that supplied affordable housing with supportive social services to elderly Medicare beneficiaries. We evaluated whether this program reduced hospital use, including hospital discharges for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (ACSCs). We compared hospital use among an intervention group residing in six high-rise buildings in two neighborhoods to that among their Medicare counterparts living in the same neighborhoods but in different buildings. We found that hospital discharge rates were 32 percent lower, hospital lengths-of-stay one day shorter, and ACSC rates 30 percent lower among residents in the intervention group than among people in the comparison group.

L.","CommunityRx: A Real-World Controlled Clinical Trial of a Scalable, Low-Intensity Community Resource Referral Intervention","OBJECTIVES: To test the effect of CommunityRx, a scalable, low-intensity intervention that matches patients to community resources, on mental health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (primary outcome), physical HRQOL, and confidence in finding resources. METHODS: A real-world trial assigned publicly insured residents of Chicago, Illinois, aged 45 to 74 years to an intervention (n = 209) or control (n = 202) group by alternating calendar week, December 2015 to August 2016. Intervention group participants received usual care and an electronic medical record-generated, personalized list of community resources. Surveys (baseline, 1-week, 1- and 3-months) measured HRQOL and confidence in finding community resources to manage health. RESULTS: At 3 months, there was no difference between groups in mental (-1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -3.02, 0.96) or physical HRQOL (0.59; 95% CI = -0.98, 2.16). Confidence in finding resources was higher in the intervention group (odds ratio = 2.08; 95% CI = 1.18, 3.63); the effect increased at each successive time point. Among intervention group participants, 65% recalled receiving the intervention; 48% shared community resource information with others. CONCLUSIONS: CommunityRx did not increase HRQOL, but its positive effect on confidence in finding resources for self-care suggests that this low-intensity intervention may have a role in population health promotion.

Frequent users are defined as having 4 or more emergency department (ED) visits or admissions, 3 or more admissions, or 2 or more admissions and 1 ED visit within 1 year. The CMP helps patients access primary care and medical and social resources. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the CMP reduces ED visits and hospitalizations among frequent users. METHOD: Between August 2007 and January 2010, a retrospective analysis was conducted using Kern Medical Center encounter data. ED visits and inpatient visits were compared pre- and postenrollment for care managed patients (n = 98). The analysis included a comparison group (n = 160) of frequent users matched on the basis of race and age. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the difference in utilization between groups, and to adjust for potential group differences. RESULTS: There was a reduction in the median number of ED visits per year from 6.0 ± 5.0 (median ± interquartile range) pre-enrollment to 1.7 ± 3.3 [corrected] postenrollment (P < 0.0001). The difference in inpatient admissions pre- and postenrollment was 0.0 ± 1.0 (P < 0.0001). After adjusting for multiple factors, multivariate analysis demonstrated that care managed patients had a 32% lower risk of visiting the ED than the comparison group (P < 0.0001). There was no difference in inpatient admissions between groups.

Rideshare services, which offer greater convenience and lower cost, have been proposed as an NEMT alternative. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of rideshare-based medical transportation on the proportion of Medicaid patients attending scheduled primary care appointments. DESIGN: In one of two similar practices, all eligible Medicaid patients were offered rideshare-based transportation (""rideshare practice""). A difference-in-difference analytical approach using logistic regression with robust standard errors was employed to compare show rate changes between the rideshare practice and the practice where rideshare was not offered (""control practice""). PARTICIPANTS: Our study population included residents of West Philadelphia who were insured by Medicaid and were established patients at two academic general internal medicine practices located in the same building. INTERVENTION: We designed a rideshare-based transportation pilot intervention. Patients were offered the service during their reminder call 2 days before the appointment, and rides were prescheduled by research staff. Patients then called research staff to schedule their return trip home. MAIN MEASURES: We assessed the effect of offering rideshare-based transportation on appointment show rates by comparing the change in the average show rate for the rideshare practice, from the baseline period to the intervention period, with the change at the control practice. KEY RESULTS: At the control practice, the show rate declined from 60% (146/245) to 51% (34/67). At the rideshare practice, the show rate improved from 54% (72/134) to 68% (41/60). In the adjusted model, controlling for patient demographics and provider type, the odds of showing up for an appointment before and after the intervention increased 2.57 (1.10-6.00) times more in the rideshare practice than in the control practice. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pilot program suggest that offering a rideshare-based transportation service can increase show rates to primary care for Medicaid patients.",29380214,,"VA Advanced Fellow at the Cpl.

Pathways to Housing allowed clients to choose the frequency and type of services they received and integrated a harm reduction philosophy to address the complex needs of individuals with dual diagnosis. The program had two requirements for clients: that they contribute 30% of their monthly income towards rent by participating in a money management plan and that they meet with a staff member at least twice a month.

METHODS: A convenience sample of families presenting to 2 urban pediatric clinics for well-child care met the following criteria: the family was Latino or black and English- or Spanish-speaking; the child was 2 to 5.9 years old, with no neurodevelopmental disability, at a gestational age of 34 weeks or more, and not attending kindergarten. Participants at the first clinic (intervention group) were exposed to a literacy support program, based on Reach Out and Read (ROR), during the previous 3 years. At the second clinic (comparison group), a similar program started 3 months before the study. Parent-child reading activities were measured using the READ Subscale of the StimQ. Language development was measured using the One-Word Expressive and Receptive Picture Vocabulary Tests, and was performed in the child's primary language. RESULTS: A total of 122 study participants (49 interventions and 73 comparisons) met inclusion criteria and completed all measures. Intervention and comparison families were similar for most sociodemographic variables. Intervention families reported reading together with their children approximately 1 more day per week. Intensity of exposure to ROR (measured by total number of contacts with the program) was associated with increased parent-child reading activities, as measured by the StimQ-Read Subscale (r = 0.20). Intervention children had higher receptive language (mean: 94.5 vs 84.8) and expressive language (mean: 84.3 vs 81.6). After adjusting for potential confounders in a multiple regression analysis, intervention status was associated with an 8.6-point increase (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 14.0) in receptive language (semipartial correlation [SR]coefficient = 0.27), and a 4.3-point increase (95% CI: 0.04, 8.6) in expressive language (SR = 0.17). In a similar multiple regression, each contact with ROR was associated with an adjusted mean 0.4-point increase (95% CI: 0.1, 0.6) in receptive score, and an adjusted mean 0.21-point increase (95% CI: 0. 02, 0.4) in expressive score.

METHODS: This intervention was informed by a mixed-method needs assessment performed December 2014-January 2015 (representative telephone survey, n=1,663; six focus groups, n=55). Evaluation design was a non-randomized, controlled quasi-experiment. Intake and 3-month follow-up data were collected February-December 2015 (follow-up response rate, 93%) on 224 intervention and 176 comparison participants, and analyzed in 2016. All participants self-reported diagnoses of hypertension, diabetes, or asthma. The intervention consisted of chronic disease self-management and goal setting through six individual CHW-led health coaching sessions, instrumental support, and facilitated access to insurance/clinical care navigation from community-based HAs. Feasibility measures included CHW service satisfaction and successful goal setting. Preliminary outcomes included clinical measures (blood pressure, BMI); disease management behaviors and self-efficacy; and preventive behaviors (physical activity). RESULTS: At the 3-month follow-up, nearly all intervention participants reported high satisfaction with their CHW (90%) and HA (76%). Intervention participants showed significant improvements in self-reported physical activity (p=0.005) and, among hypertensive participants, self-reported routine blood pressure self-monitoring (p=0.013) compared with comparison participants. No improvements were observed in self-efficacy or clinical measures at the 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Housing-based initiatives involving CHW and HA teams are acceptable to public housing residents and can be effectively implemented to achieve rapid improvements in physical activity and chronic disease self-management. At 3-month assessment, additional time and efforts are required to improve clinical outcomes.",28215382,Am J Prev Med,"Lopez, Priscilla M.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate a care coordination program designed to provide combined ""whole-person care,"" integrating medical, behavioral, and social support for high-cost, high-need Medicaid beneficiaries by targeting access barriers and social determinants. RESEARCH DESIGN: Individual-level interrupted time series with a comparator group, using person-month as the unit of analysis. SUBJECTS: A total of 42,214 UnitedHealthcare Medicaid beneficiaries (194,834 person-months) age 21 years or above with diabetes, with Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Medicaid expansion, Supplemental Security Income without Medicare, or dual Medicaid/Medicare. MEASURES: Our outcome measures were any hospitalizations and any ED visits in a given month. Covariates of interest included an indicator for intervention versus comparator group and indicator and spline variables measuring changes in an outcome's time trend after program enrollment. RESULTS: Overall, 6 of the 8 examined comparisons were not statistically significant. Among Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries, we observed a larger projected decrease in ED visit risk among the intervention sample versus the comparator sample at 12 months postenrollment (difference-in-difference: -6.6%; 95% confidence interval: -11.2%, -2.1%). Among expansion beneficiaries, we observed a greater decrease in hospitalization risk among the intervention sample versus the comparator sample at 12 months postenrollment (difference-in-difference: -5.8%; 95% confidence interval: -11.4%, -0.2%). CONCLUSION: A care coordination program designed to reduce utilization among high-cost, high-need Medicaid beneficiaries was associated with fewer ED visits and hospitalizations for patients with diabetes in selected Medicaid programs but not others.",32412949,Med Care,"Duru, O Kenrik.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate impacts of a social needs screening and navigation program for adult predicted high utilizers on total medical visit utilization. DESIGN: A prospective, quasi-experimental study using an intent-to-treat propensity-weighted difference-in-differences approach. Stratified analyses assessed intervention effects among three low-socioeconomic status sub-samples: patients in low-income areas, in low-education areas, and with Medicaid insurance. PARTICIPANTS: Predicted high utilizers-patients predicted to be in the highest 1% for total utilization in a large integrated health system. INTERVENTION: A telephonic social needs screening and navigation program. MAIN MEASURES: Primary difference-in-difference analyses compared total visit count utilization, including outpatient, emergency department (ED), and inpatient utilization, between the intervention and control groups at both in-network and out-of-network facilities. Prevalence of social needs among sample patients and their connection rates to social needs resources are also described. KEY RESULTS: The study included 34,225 patients (7107 intervention, 27,118 control). Most (53%) patients screened reported social needs, but only a minority (10%) of those with a need were able to connect with resources to address these needs. Primary analysis found total utilization visits decreased 2.2% (95% CI - 4.5%, 0.1%; p = 0.058) in the intervention group. Stratified analyses showed decreases in total utilization for all low-socioeconomic status subgroups receiving the intervention compared with controls: - 7.0% (95% CI - 11.9%, - 1.9%; p = 0.008) in the low-income area group, - 11.5% (- 17.6%, 5.0%; p < 0.001) in the low-education area group, and - 12.1% (- 18.1%, - 5.6%; p < 0.001) in the Medicaid group. CONCLUSIONS: Social needs navigation programs for high-utilizing patients may have modest effects on utilization for the population overall.

Objective: To determine the effectiveness of the Health Leads program on improvement in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level. Design, Setting, and Participants: A difference-in-difference evaluation of the Health Leads program was conducted from October 1, 2012, through September 30, 2015, at 3 academic primary care practices. Health Leads consists of screening for unmet needs at clinic visits, and offering those who screen positive to meet with an advocate to help obtain resources, or receive brief information provision. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes in SBP, DBP, LDL-C level, and HbA1c level. We compared those who screened positive for unmet basic needs (Health Leads group) with those who screened negative, using intention-to-treat, and, secondarily, between those who did and did not enroll in Health Leads, using linear mixed modeling, examining the period before and after screening. Results: A total of 5125 people were screened, using a standardized form, for unmet basic resource needs; 3351 screened negative and 1774 screened positive. For those who screened positive, the mean age was 57.6 years and 1811 (56%) were women. For those who screened negative, the mean age was 56.7 years and 909 (57%) were women. Of 5125 people screened, 1774 (35%) reported at least 1 unmet need, and 1021 (58%) of those enrolled in Health Leads. Median follow-up for those who screened positive and negative was 34 and 32 months, respectively. In unadjusted intention-to-treat analyses of 1998 participants with hypertension, the Health Leads group experienced greater reduction in SBP (differential change, -1.2; 95% CI, -2.1 to -0.4) and DBP (differential change, -1.0; 95% CI, -1.5 to -0.5). For 2281 individuals with an indication for LDL-C level lowering, results also favored the Health Leads group (differential change, -3.7; 95% CI -6.7 to -0.6). For 774 individuals with diabetes, the Health Leads group did not show HbA1c level improvement (differential change, -0.04%; 95% CI, -0.17% to 0.10%). Results adjusted for baseline demographic and clinical differences were not qualitatively different. Among those who enrolled in Health Leads program, there were greater BP and LDL-C level improvements than for those who declined (SBP differential change -2.6; 95% CI,-3.5 to -1.7; SBP differential change, -1.4; 95% CI, -1.9 to -0.9; LDL-C level differential change, -6.3; 95% CI, -9.7 to -2.8).

Long-term VIP performance has not been assessed. Violence intervention program quality improvement requires evaluation to identify shortcomings and client subpopulations warranting additional resources. We evaluated our case manager-based VIPs to identify modifiable risk factors that most impact violent injury recidivism and determine subpopulations that need modification of targeted services. METHODS: Data on demographic variables, socioeconomic factors, needs, and injury recidivism from 2005 to 2014 were collected through our VIP database. Possible client needs included housing, education, employment, court advocacy, driver's license obtainment, and ""other."" Case managers assessed needs as ""not needed,"" ""identified (unmet),"" and ""met."" chi And nonparametric tests were used to identify factors associated with recidivism reduction. RESULTS: Over the 10-year period, 466 clients were enrolled in VIP. During the program period, the violent reinjury rate was 4%, as compared with a historical control of 8% from 2000 to 2004. Women had lower rates of reinjury than men (3% vs 13%, respectively, p = 0.023). Blacks had the lowest recidivism (2%, p < 0.0001), whereas a higher rate (11%) was observed among Latinos. Although a minority of clients (5%), 100% of white clients were reinjured. Mental health services (51%), victim-of-crime compensation (48%), employment (36%), and housing (30%) were the most frequently identified needs. Expressing the need for education was significantly associated with likelihood of reinjury, an effect that was completely reversed when the need was met. CONCLUSION: This evaluation of a VIP demonstrates sustained recidivism reduction and success in addressing client needs from a traditionally underserved population. Efforts to identify and address root causes of Latino and white client reinjury should be increased. Violence intervention program prioritization of housing needs may reduce future reinjury. This study demonstrating sustainable success underscores the importance of increased integration of VIP into trauma centers nationally.

Whether food insecurity interventions improve cardiometabolic health is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of women who visited the obstetrics clinic in a community health center from 2013 through 2015. Patients could be referred to the Food for Families (Food for Families) program, which connects food insecure women to food resources. We hypothesized that participation in Food for Families would be associated with better blood pressure and blood glucose trends during pregnancy. We used a propensity score-matched design to reduce bias from differential entry into Food for Families. RESULTS: Eleven percent of women who visited the obstetrics clinic were referred to Food for Families. In propensity score-matched analyses, we found no difference in baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) between those who were referred and enrolled in Food for Families (113.5 mm Hg), those who were referred and did not enroll in Food for Families (113.9 mm Hg), and those who were not referred to Food for Families (114 mm Hg) (P = .79). However, during pregnancy, women who were referred to and enrolled in Food for Families had a better SBP trend (0.2015 mm Hg/wk lower, P = .006). SBP trends did not differ between women who were referred and did not enroll in Food for Families and those who were not referred. We observed no differences in blood glucose trends between groups (P = .40). CONCLUSIONS: Food for Families participation was associated with better blood pressure trends in pregnant women but no differences in blood glucose trends.

However, low-income patients may face challenges related to poverty that make it difficult to engage in lifestyle changes. We piloted an intervention designed to help older, low-income, Hispanic, patients with diabetes access free or low-cost community resources to enhance diabetes self-management. Results from this pilot intervention are reported. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were recruited at baseline to complete surveys assessing diabetes self-care activities, diabetes self-efficacy, and general self-efficacy. Volunteers were trained by a clinic social worker to help patients identify needs and make referrals to local community resources (e.g., housing, transportation, food, clothing, dental and prescription services, employment, or family social services). Identical surveys were administered at 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: 28 patients were recruited at baseline and 18 patients completed the follow-up assessment. No significant changes in diabetes care and self-efficacy were detected. All patients requested at least one referral to a community resource. The most common requests were for low-cost dental clinics, food assistance, and housing support. At follow-up, nine (50%) patients contacted their given referrals. CONCLUSIONS: The need for assistance with basic social services is high in this population. The rate of referral uptake (50%) is high for a relatively low intensity intervention. Since the completion of the pilot, the program has trained 21 volunteers and helped over 220 patients in a primary care clinic.

This violates warranty of habitability laws in most of the states, but patients often find it beyond their means to remedy their housing situation. We aimed to study the effect of a medical-legal collaborative intervention to force landlords into providing better living conditions for patients with poorly controlled asthma. METHODS: We retrospectively studied charts of adult patients aged 18 years or older with poorly controlled asthma (moderate or severe persistent) despite maximum medical therapy. Additionally, patients had self-reported domestic allergen exposures such as mold, cockroaches, mice or rats, and dust. The patients received legal assistance to improve their domestic environments, including fixing leaks, exterminating pests, or providing a different apartment. Post-intervention change in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), asthma severity class, medications, emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and requirement for systemic steroids for symptom control was assessed. RESULTS: Data were available for 12 patients (9-12 months pre-intervention and 6-12 months post-intervention). Analysis of paired data revealed that mean PEFR rose by 38.6 LPM (95% CI: 9.9-67.3; p = .014).

METHODS: Study participants consisted of parents who brought their children to the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center pediatric emergency department for nonurgent complaints. Study participants filled out questionnaires regarding their management of children's mild health complaints and where respondents first seek help when their children become sick. After completing the questionnaires, participants were educated about how to use the health aid book What to Do When Your Child Gets Sick and provided a free copy. After 6 months, telephone follow-up interviews were conducted to assess whether the health literacy intervention had influenced the participants' management of their children's mild health complaints and their health care resource usage patterns. RESULTS: One hundred thirteen parents were enrolled in the preintervention phase, and 61 were successfully interviewed at 6 months by telephone. Before and after comparisons demonstrated a 13% reduction in the percentage of respondents who stated they would go to the emergency department first if their child became sick. In addition, 30% fewer respondents reported actual visits to the emergency department in the previous 6 months. Regarding specific low-acuity scenarios, significantly fewer participants would take their child to the emergency department for a low-grade fever with a temperature of 99.5 degrees F and for vomiting for 1 day. There was no significant change in the proportion of parents who would take their child to the emergency department for earache or cough.

Behavioral health, social work, dietetics, patient navigation, and other services that address patients' social and behavioral needs are co-located with primary care services. In an eleven-year panel of primary care patients, receipt of any wraparound service was negatively associated with subsequent hospitalizations and emergency department visits. The estimated cost savings from potentially avoided hospitalizations alone was $1.4 million annually.

The cohort study included intervention participants who first enrolled between December 2014 and March 2015. Participants were excluded if they could not complete the assessment because of illness or language. The authors examined changes in cost-related medication underuse (CRMU), transportation barriers, and food insecurity (FI). For the qualitative analysis, a random sample of 80 participants was selected for electronic health record review - 40 cases who showed clinical improvement (responders) and 40 cases who did not (nonresponders). Themes were extracted by 3 reviewers guided by the immersion/crystallization approach. For the cohort study, 141 individuals were included; 138 (97.9%) completed follow-up. Comparing baseline to follow-up, there were significant reductions in the prevalence of CRMU (from 44.2% to 39.1%, P = .003) and transportation barriers (from 46.3% to 30.2%, P = .001), but not FI (from 40.4% to 38.2%, P = .73).

We described the national implementation of a ""homeless medical home"" initiative in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and correlated patient health outcomes with characteristics of high-performing sites. METHODS: We conducted an observational study of 33 VHA facilities with homeless medical homes and patient- aligned care teams that served more than 14,000 patients. We correlated site-specific health care performance data for the 3,543 homeless veterans enrolled in the program from October 2013 through March 2014, including those receiving ambulatory or acute health care services during the 6 months prior to enrollment in our study and 6 months post-enrollment with corresponding survey data on the Homeless Patient Aligned Care Team (H-PACT) program implementation. We defined high performance as high rates of ambulatory care and reduced use of acute care services. RESULTS: More than 96% of VHA patients enrolled in these programs were concurrently receiving VHA homeless services. Of the 33 sites studied, 82% provided hygiene care (on-site showers, hygiene kits, and laundry), 76% provided transportation, and 55% had an on-site clothes pantry; 42% had a food pantry and provided on-site meals or other food assistance. Six-month patterns of acute-care use pre-enrollment and post-enrollment for 3,543 consecutively enrolled patients showed a 19.0% reduction in emergency department use and a 34.7% reduction in hospitalizations. Three features were significantly associated with high performance: 1) higher staffing ratios than other sites, 1) integration of social supports and social services into clinical care, and 3) outreach to and integration with community agencies.

D.",An intervention to improve care and reduce costs for high-risk patients with frequent hospital admissions: a pilot study,"BACKGROUND: A small percentage of high-risk patients accounts for a large proportion of Medicaid spending in the United States, which has become an urgent policy issue. Our objective was to pilot a novel patient-centered intervention for high-risk patients with frequent hospital admissions to determine its potential to improve care and reduce costs. METHODS: Community and hospital-based care management and coordination intervention with pre-post analysis of health care utilization. We enrolled Medicaid fee-for-service patients aged 18-64 who were admitted to an urban public hospital and identified as being at high risk for hospital readmission by a validated predictive algorithm. Enrolled patients were evaluated using qualitative and quantitative interview techniques to identify needs such as transportation to/advocacy during medical appointments, mental health/substance use treatment, and home visits. A community housing partner initiated housing applications in-hospital for homeless patients. Care managers facilitated appropriate discharge plans then worked closely with patients in the community using a harm reduction approach. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were enrolled; all were male, 18/19 were substance users, and 17/19 were homeless. Patients had a total of 64 inpatient admissions in the 12 months before the intervention, versus 40 in the following 12 months, a 37.5% reduction. Most patients (73.3%) had fewer inpatient admissions in the year after the intervention compared to the prior year. Overall ED visits also decreased after study enrollment, while outpatient clinic visits increased. Yearly study hospital Medicaid reimbursements fell an average of $16,383 per patient. CONCLUSIONS: A pilot intervention for high-cost patients shows promising results for health services usage. We are currently expanding our model to serve more patients at additional hospitals to see if the pilot's success can be replicated.

Objective: To determine the effectiveness of the Health Leads program on improvement in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level. Design, Setting, and Participants: A difference-in-difference evaluation of the Health Leads program was conducted from October 1, 2012, through September 30, 2015, at 3 academic primary care practices. Health Leads consists of screening for unmet needs at clinic visits, and offering those who screen positive to meet with an advocate to help obtain resources, or receive brief information provision. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes in SBP, DBP, LDL-C level, and HbA1c level. We compared those who screened positive for unmet basic needs (Health Leads group) with those who screened negative, using intention-to-treat, and, secondarily, between those who did and did not enroll in Health Leads, using linear mixed modeling, examining the period before and after screening. Results: A total of 5125 people were screened, using a standardized form, for unmet basic resource needs; 3351 screened negative and 1774 screened positive. For those who screened positive, the mean age was 57.6 years and 1811 (56%) were women. For those who screened negative, the mean age was 56.7 years and 909 (57%) were women. Of 5125 people screened, 1774 (35%) reported at least 1 unmet need, and 1021 (58%) of those enrolled in Health Leads. Median follow-up for those who screened positive and negative was 34 and 32 months, respectively. In unadjusted intention-to-treat analyses of 1998 participants with hypertension, the Health Leads group experienced greater reduction in SBP (differential change, -1.2; 95% CI, -2.1 to -0.4) and DBP (differential change, -1.0; 95% CI, -1.5 to -0.5). For 2281 individuals with an indication for LDL-C level lowering, results also favored the Health Leads group (differential change, -3.7; 95% CI -6.7 to -0.6). For 774 individuals with diabetes, the Health Leads group did not show HbA1c level improvement (differential change, -0.04%; 95% CI, -0.17% to 0.10%). Results adjusted for baseline demographic and clinical differences were not qualitatively different. Among those who enrolled in Health Leads program, there were greater BP and LDL-C level improvements than for those who declined (SBP differential change -2.6; 95% CI,-3.5 to -1.7; SBP differential change, -1.4; 95% CI, -1.9 to -0.9; LDL-C level differential change, -6.3; 95% CI, -9.7 to -2.8).

Health care costs for the homeless reflect both their medical complexity and psychosocial risk factors. Supportive housing attempts to moderate both by providing stable places to live along with on-site integrated health services. In this pilot study we used a mixture of survey and administrative claims data to evaluate outcomes for formerly homeless people who were living in a supportive housing facility in Oregon between 2010 and 2014. Results from the claims analysis showed significantly lower overall health care expenditures for the people after they moved into supportive housing. Expenditure changes were driven primarily by reductions in emergency and inpatient care. Survey data suggest that the savings were not at the expense of quality: Respondents reported improved access to care, stronger primary care connections, and better subjective health outcomes.

The Head-off Environmental Asthma in Louisiana (HEAL) intervention integrated asthma counseling (AC) capacity and addressed challenges facing children with asthma in post-disaster New Orleans. METHODS: The HEAL intervention enrolled 182 children (4-12 years) with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma. Recruitment occurred from schools in the Greater New Orleans area for one year. Participants received home environmental assessments and tailored asthma counseling sessions during the study period based on the National Cooperative Inner City Asthma Study and the Inner City Asthma Study. Primary (i.e., asthma symptoms) and secondary outcomes (i.e., healthcare utilization) were captured. During the study, changes were made to meet the demands of a post-hurricane and resource-poor environment which included changes to staffing, training, AC tools, and AC sessions. RESULTS: After study changes were made, the AC visit rate increased by 92.3%. Significant improvements were observed across several adherence measures (e.g., running out of medications (p = 0.009), financial/insurance problems for appointments (p = 0.006), worried about medication side-effects (p = 0.01), felt medications did not work (p < 0.001)). Additionally, an increasing number of AC visits was modestly associated with a greater reduction in symptoms (test-for-trend p = 0.059). CONCLUSION: By adapting to the needs of the study population and setting, investigators successfully implemented a counseling intervention that improved participant behaviors and clinical outcomes. The strategies for implementing the AC intervention may serve as a guide for managing asthma and other chronic conditions in resource-poor settings.",27049234,J Asthma,"Thornton, Eleanor. a Visionary Consulting Partners, LLC, Mason Enterprise Center-Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia, USA.

We describe the efforts of a private practice physical therapy (PT) clinic to reduce these barriers by offering a door-to-door van service at no cost to patients. Methods: Clinic records and national census databases were retrospectively reviewed to explore the impact of offering no-cost van rides to patients attending outpatient PT appointments.

Paired t-tests compared PT clinic attendance rates (percentage of scheduled visits that were attended) before and after implementation of the van service. Results: Use of the van service increased significantly over time, from a mean of 83 riders per month in 2010 to 205 riders per month in 2013 (p < 0.001).

However, identification of independent components that contribute to outcomes and delineating effectiveness by level of asthma symptoms would help to refine the intervention and target appropriate populations. METHODS: A community health educator led asthma intervention implemented in a low-income African-American neighborhood included asthma management education, individually tailored low-cost asthma home trigger remediation, and referrals to social and medical agencies, when appropriate. Changes in asthma morbidity measures were assessed in relation to implementation of individual intervention components using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the 218 children who completed the year-long program, there were significant reductions in measures of asthma morbidity, including symptoms, urgent care visits, emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, missed school days, and missed work days for caretakers. We also found significant decreases in the prevalence of many home asthma triggers and improvements in asthma management practices. Improvement in caretaker's ability to manage the child's asthma was associated with reduction in ED visits for asthma and uncontrolled asthma. Specific home interventions, such as repair of water leaks and reduced exposure to plants, dust, clutter and stuffed toys, may be related to reduction in asthma morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: This program was effective in reducing asthma morbidity in low-income African-American children and identified specific interventions as possible areas to target in future projects.

Housing placement significantly reduced the percentage of residents with an emergency department visit (53 to 37 percent), the average number of visits per person (1.94 to .86), and the total number of emergency department visits (56 percent decrease, from 457 to 202) for the sample as a whole. For hospitalizations, permanent supportive housing placement significantly reduced the likelihood of being hospitalized (19 to 11 percent) and the mean number of admissions per person (.34 to .19 admissions per resident).

METHODS: We conducted a nonblinded interventional trial at an urban, safety net, hospital ED with a census of 39,000 annually. IMPACT-ED identified patients who had no source of regular care and lived in a 15-ZIP-code low-income area served by 3 community clinics. Emergency physicians received an automated notification through the electronic medical record to access an imbedded software program for scheduling follow-up clinic appointments. Patients who would benefit from a follow-up clinic visit within 2 weeks as determined by the emergency physician received a computer-generated appointment time and clinic map with bus routes as part of their discharge instructions, and the clinics received an electronic notification of the appointment. We compared frequency of follow-up for a 6-month period before implementation when patients received written instructions to call the clinic on their own (pre-IMPACT) and 6 months after implementation (post-IMPACT). Statistical analysis was conducted with chi(2) testing, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals are presented. RESULTS: There were 326 patients who received an appointment (post-IMPACT), of whom 81 followed up at the clinic as directed (24.8%), compared with 399 patients who received a referral (pre-IMPACT), of whom 4 followed up as directed (1.0%), for an absolute improvement of 23.8% (95% confidence interval 19.1% to 28.6%).

Traditional hospital personnel often lack the time, skills, and community linkages required to address these factors. OBJECTIVE To determine whether a tailored community health worker (CHW) intervention would improve posthospital outcomes among low-SES patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 2-armed, single-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted between April 10, 2011, and October 30, 2012, at 2 urban, academically affiliated hospitals. Of 683 eligible general medical inpatients (ie, low-income, uninsured, or Medicaid) that we screened, 237 individuals (34.7%) declined to participate. The remaining 446 patients (65.3%) were enrolled and randomly assigned to study arms. Nearly equal percentages of control and intervention group patients completed the follow-up interview (86.6% vs 86.9%). INTERVENTIONS During hospital admission, CHWs worked with patients to create individualized action plans for achieving patients' stated goals for recovery. The CHWs provided support tailored to patient goals for a minimum of 2 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The prespecified primary outcome was completion of primary care follow-up within 14 days of discharge. Prespecified secondary outcomes were quality of discharge communication, self-rated health, satisfaction, patient activation, medication adherence, and 30-day readmission rates. RESULTS Using intention-to-treat analysis, we found that intervention patients were more likely to obtain timely posthospital primary care (60.0% vs 47.9%; P = .02; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.52; 95% CI, 1.03-2.23), to report high-quality discharge communication (91.3% vs 78.7%; P = .002; adjusted OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.5-5.8), and to show greater improvements in mental health (6.7 vs 4.5; P = .02) and patient activation (3.4 vs 1.6; P = .05). There were no significant differences between groups in physical health, satisfaction with medical care, or medication adherence. Similar proportions of patients in both arms experienced at least one 30-day readmission; however, intervention patients were less likely to have multiple 30-day readmissions (2.3% vs 5.5%; P = .08; adjusted OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.14-1.06). Among the subgroup of 63 readmitted patients, recurrent readmission was reduced from 40.0% vs 15.2% (P = .03; adjusted OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.89). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patient-centered CHW intervention improves access to primary care and quality of discharge while controlling recurrent readmissions in a high-risk population. Health systems may leverage the CHW workforce to improve posthospital outcomes by addressing behavioral and socioeconomic drivers of disease.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether an ED-initiated Patient Navigation program (ED-PN) designed to improve health care access for Medicaid-insured frequent ED users could decrease ED visits, hospitalizations, and costs. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing ED-PN with usual care (UC) among 100 Medicaid-enrolled frequent ED users (defined as 4-18 ED visits in the prior year), assessing ED utilization during the 12 months pre- and post-enrollment. Secondary outcomes included hospitalizations, outpatient utilization, hospital costs, and Medicaid costs. We also compared characteristics between ED-PN patients with and without reduced ED utilization. RESULTS: Of 214 eligible patients approached, 100 (47%) consented to participate. Forty-nine were randomized to ED-PN and 51 to UC. Sociodemographic characteristics and prior utilization were similar between groups. ED-PN participants had a significant reduction in ED visits and hospitalizations during the 12-month evaluation period compared with UC, averaging 1.4 fewer ED visits per patient (p = 0.01) and 1.0 fewer hospitalizations per patient (p = 0.001). Both groups increased outpatient utilization. ED-PN patients showed a trend toward reduced per-patient hospital costs (-$10,201, p = 0.10); Medicaid costs were unchanged (-$5,765, p = 0.26). Patients who demonstrated a reduction in ED usage were older (mean age 42 vs. 33 years, p = 0.03) and had lower health literacy (78% low health literacy vs. 40%, p = 0.02).

METHODS: Using a randomized design, an intensive case-management intervention was tested with patients identified at a Level 1 urban trauma center from April 2002 through July 2002. Following assessment in the ED, six-month follow-up data were gathered from four primary care sites (two Federally Qualified Health Centers, two hospital outpatient clinics) and two area hospitals. Eligible participants were uninsured, were at least 18 years of age, and did not have a regular primary care provider. Of 281 patients approached, 273 (97.2%) agreed to participate. After 42 patients were eliminated following enrollment due to ineligibility, there were 121 intervention and 109 comparison subjects. Health Promotion Advocates (HPAs) in the ED gathered information from all study participants. On intervention shifts, HPAs assisted patients in choosing a primary care provider and faxed all information to a case worker at the selected site. Case managers attempted to contact patients and schedule appointments. On comparison shifts, patients received care as usual. Primary care contact in 60 days and subsequent ED visits in six months post-ED assessment were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: Intervention subjects were more likely to have a primary care contact (51.2% vs. 13.8%, p < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in either number of inpatient admissions or postintervention ED visits, although postintervention ED visits for the intervention group were less expensive.

All patients set a disease-management goal. Patients randomly assigned to CHWs also received 6 months of support tailored to their goals and preferences. RESULTS: Support from CHWs (vs goal-setting alone) led to improvements in several chronic diseases (changes in glycosylated hemoglobin: -0.4 vs 0.0; body mass index: -0.3 vs -0.1; cigarettes per day: -5.5 vs -1.3; systolic blood pressure: -1.8 vs -11.2; overall P = .08), self-rated mental health (12-item Short Form survey; 2.3 vs -0.2; P = .008), and quality of care (Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems; 62.9% vs 38%; P < .001), while reducing hospitalization at 1 year by 28% (P = .11).

OBJECTIVES: To test the effectiveness of a geriatric care management model on improving the quality of care for low-income seniors in primary care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Controlled clinical trial of 951 adults 65 years or older with an annual income less than 200% of the federal poverty level, whose primary care physicians were randomized from January 2002 through August 2004 to participate in the intervention (474 patients) or usual care (477 patients) in community-based health centers. INTERVENTION: Patients received 2 years of home-based care management by a nurse practitioner and social worker who collaborated with the primary care physician and a geriatrics interdisciplinary team and were guided by 12 care protocols for common geriatric conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Medical Outcomes 36-Item Short-Form (SF-36) scales and summary measures; instrumental and basic activities of daily living (ADLs); and emergency department (ED) visits not resulting in hospitalization and hospitalizations. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significant improvements for intervention patients compared with usual care at 24 months in 4 of 8 SF-36 scales: general health (0.2 vs -2.3, P = .045), vitality (2.6 vs -2.6, P < .001), social functioning (3.0 vs -2.3, P = .008), and mental health (3.6 vs -0.3, P = .001); and in the Mental Component Summary (2.1 vs -0.3, P < .001). No group differences were found for ADLs or death. The cumulative 2-year ED visit rate per 1000 was lower in the intervention group (1445 [n = 474] vs 1748 [n = 477], P = .03) but hospital admission rates per 1000 were not significantly different between groups (700 [n = 474] vs 740 [n = 477], P = .66). In a predefined group at high risk of hospitalization (comprising 112 intervention and 114 usual-care patients), ED visit and hospital admission rates were lower for intervention patients in the second year (848 [n = 106] vs 1314 [n = 105]; P = .03 and 396 [n = 106] vs 705 [n = 105]; P = .03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Integrated and home-based geriatric care management resulted in improved quality of care and reduced acute care utilization among a high-risk group. Improvements in health-related quality of life were mixed and physical function outcomes did not differ between groups. Future studies are needed to determine whether more specific targeting will improve the program's effectiveness and whether reductions in acute care utilization will offset program costs.

The intervention focused on four contextual sources of depression in underserved, low-income communities: underemployment, inadequate housing, food insecurity, and violence. A multi-method design included quantitative and ethnographic techniques to study predictors of depression and the intervention's impact. After a structured training program, primary care practitioners (PCPs) and promotoras collaboratively followed a clinical algorithm in which PCPs prescribed medications and/or arranged consultations by mental health professionals and promotoras addressed the contextual sources of depression. Based on an intake interview with 464 randomly recruited patients, 120 patients with depression were randomized to enhanced care plus the promotora contextual intervention, or to enhanced care alone. All four contextual problems emerged as strong predictors of depression (chi square, p < .05); logistic regression revealed housing and food insecurity as the most important predictors (odds ratios both 2.40, p < .05). Unexpected challenges arose in the intervention's implementation, involving infrastructure at the health centers, boundaries of the promotoras' roles, and ""turf"" issues with medical assistants.

DESIGN: Changes in indoor allergen levels and asthma severity measurements were compared between children who were randomized to intervention and delayed intervention groups in a 14-month prospective field trial. Intervention group households received dust mite covers, a professional house cleaning, and had roach bait and trays placed in their houses. RESULTS: Of 981 eligible children, 410 (42%) were enrolled; 161 (40%) completed baseline activities and were randomized: 84 to intervention and 77 to delayed intervention groups. At the study's end, dust mite levels were 163% higher than at baseline for the delayed intervention group. Overall asthma severity scores did not change. However, the median functional severity score (FSS) component of the severity score improved more in the intervention group (33% vs. 20%) than in the delayed intervention group. At the study's end, the median FSSs for the intervention group improved 25% compared with the delayed intervention group, (p<0.01). Differences between groups for medication use, emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalization were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Despite low retention, the intervention resulted in decreased dust mite allergen levels and increased FSSs among the intervention group.

We used surveys to identify ER visits and hospitalizations during the 12 months preceding and following program enrollment or wait list entry. RESULTS: Hospitalizations decreased from the year before entry to the year following entry in participants with immediate and delayed (6.0% vs 8.8% decrease) access.

This worker did not need to have a professional degree and a psychiatrist or other mental health professional supervised the CTI worker. The CTI worker provided support for both the participant and those who could assist him in the areas of treatment that were selected. This generally entailed visiting the family home or community residence, being present at appointments, and giving advice in crises.

The primary goals of the case management were to improve the financial and residential stability of the clients and to reduce their use of alcohol. METHOD: Subjects (N = 298, 81% male) were interviewed at baseline, randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions and given follow-up interviews at 6-month intervals for 2 years. Case management services were provided for the duration of the project. Follow-up rates for the first three interviews averaged 82%. RESULTS: Repeated measures MANCOVAs showed significant group differences favoring the case-managed group in all three areas targeted by the intervention: total income from public sources, nights spent in ""own place"" out of the previous 60 nights and days drinking out of the previous 30 days. The results held whether the three variables were analyzed jointly or separately and for alternative measures of drinking and homelessness.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Patients were randomized to intervention or active control conditions by the day of the week. Primary outcomes observed at 4 months after enrollment included caregivers' reports of social needs and child health status. Recruitment occurred between October 13, 2013, and August 27, 2015, in pediatric primary and urgent care clinics in 2 safety-net hospitals. Participants were English-speaking or Spanish-speaking caregivers accompanying minor children to nonacute medical visits. Interventions: After standardized screening, caregivers either received written information on relevant community services (active control) or received in-person help to access services with follow-up telephone calls for further assistance if needed (navigation intervention). Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in reported social needs and in caregiver assessment of child's overall health reported 4 months later. Results: Among 1809 patients enrolled in the study, evenly split between the 2 sites, 31.6% (n = 572) were enrolled in a primary care clinic and 68.4% (n = 1237) were enrolled in an urgent care setting.

Patients who resided in a high-poverty zip code, were uninsured or publicly insured, and who had a diagnosis for 2 or more chronic diseases were recruited, and patients were randomized to either the CHW intervention or the control arm (goal setting only).

The secondary outcomes were self-rated mental health, chronic disease control, patient activation, patient-reported quality of primary care, and all-cause hospitalization. Results: Of the 592 participants, 370 (62.5%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 52.6 (11.1) years.

Conclusions and Relevance: A standardized intervention did not improve self-rated health but did improve the patient-perceived quality of care while reducing hospitalizations, suggesting that health systems may use a standardized intervention to address the social determinants of health.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate effects of a transitional care practice (TC) that comprehensively addresses patients' medical and psychosocial needs following hospital discharge. DESIGN: Pragmatic, randomized comparative effectiveness trial. PATIENTS: Adults discharged from an initial emergency, observation, or inpatient hospital encounter with no trusted usual source of care. INTERVENTIONS: TC intervention included a scheduled post-discharge appointment at the TC practice, where a multidisciplinary team comprehensively assessed patients' medical and psychosocial needs, addressed modifiable barriers, and subsequent linkage to a new primary care source. Routine Care involved assistance scheduling a post-discharge appointment with a primary care provider that often partnered with the hospital where the initial encounter occurred. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was a binary indicator of death or additional hospital encounters within 90 days of initial discharge. Secondary outcomes included any additional hospital encounters, and counts of hospital encounters, over 180 days. KEY RESULTS: Four hundred ninety patients were randomized to TC intervention and 164 to Routine Care; 34.6% were uninsured, 49.7% had Medicaid, and 57.4% were homeless or lived in a high-poverty area. There was no significant difference between arms in the 90-day probability of death or additional hospital encounters (relative risk [RR] 0.89; 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-1.13). However, TC patients had 37% and 35% lower probability of any inpatient admission over 90 days (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.43-0.91) and 180 days (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.47-0.89), respectively. Over 180 days, TC patients had 42% fewer inpatient admissions (incidence rate ratio 0.58; 95% CI 0.37-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients randomized to a patient-centered transitional care intervention, there was no significant reduction in 90-day probability of death or additional hospital encounters. However, there were significant decreases in measures of inpatient admissions over 180 days.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that CHW home visits for adults with uncontrolled asthma improve outcomes relative to usual care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized parallel group study with 1-year follow-up, conducted 2008 through 2011 at homes of low-income adults aged 18 to 65 years with uncontrolled asthma living in King County, Washington. INTERVENTIONS: The CHWs provided a mean of 4.9 home visits during a 1-year period to assess asthma control, self-management, and home environment and to support asthma self-management practices. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary prespecified outcomes were symptom-free days (number of 24-hour periods in prior 2 weeks without asthma symptoms), asthma-related quality of life (Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire), and asthma-related unscheduled health care use. RESULTS: Of 463 individuals who completed eligibility screening, 443 were eligible, 366 participated (177 in intervention and 189 in control groups), and 333 completed the study (91%). The intervention group had significantly greater increases in mean symptom-free days per 2 weeks (2.02 [95% CI, 0.94-3.09]; P < .001) and quality of life (0.50 [95% CI, 0.28-0.71] points; P < .001) relative to the control group, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education level. The number needed to treat to increase symptom-free days by 2 days per 2 weeks was 7.4 and to improve quality of life by 0.5 points was 2.6. Mean urgent health care use episodes in the past 12 months decreased significantly and similarly in both groups, from a mean of 3.46 to 1.99 episodes in the intervention group (mean change, -1.47 [95% CI, -2.28 to -0.67]; P < .001) and from a mean of 3.30 to 1.96 episodes in the control group (mean change, -1.34 [95% CI, -2.00 to -0.72]; P < .001) (P = .83 comparing groups). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The provision of in-home asthma self-management support by CHWs to low-income adults with uncontrolled asthma improves asthma control and quality of life but not unscheduled health care use.

Adapted from an evidence-based practice to prevent chronic homelessness for adults with mental illnesses, FCTI combines housing and structured, time-limited case management to connect families leaving shelter with community services. Families were followed at five time points over 24 months. Data on 311 children-99 ages 1.5-5 years, 113 ages 6-10 years, and 99 ages 11-16 years-included mother-, teacher-, and child-reports of mental health, school experiences, and psychosocial well-being. Analyses used hierarchical linear modeling to investigate intervention effects and changes in child functioning over time. Referral to FCTI reduced internalizing and externalizing problems in preschool-aged children and externalizing for adolescents 11-16. The intervention led to declines in self-reported school troubles for children 6-10 and 11-16. Both experimental and control children in all age groups showed reductions in symptoms over time.

Twelve-month outcome data from a randomized trial of the Housing and Urban Development- Veterans Affairs Supported Housing program (HUD-VASH) showed that access to a housing rent subsidy plus intensive case management (ICM) was associated with greater improvement in subjective quality of life than ICM alone. Multiple mediation analyses were applied to identify variables that significantly mediated the relationship between receipt of housing voucher and improvements in quality of life. Significant mediating covariates were those whose 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals, when added to the model predicting improvement in quality of life, did not overlap zero. Increases in the number of days housed, size of social network, and availability of emotional support appear to mediate improvement in quality of life and account for 71% of the benefit attributable to having a rent subsidy. Improvement in subjective quality of life though housing subsidies is mediated by gains in both material and psychosocial factors.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a case management and housing program in reducing use of urgent medical services among homeless adults with chronic medical illnesses. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized controlled trial conducted at a public teaching hospital and a private, nonprofit hospital in Chicago, Illinois. Participants were 407 social worker-referred homeless adults with chronic medical illnesses (89% of referrals) from September 2003 until May 2006, with follow-up through December 2007. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. INTERVENTION: Housing offered as transitional housing after hospitalization discharge, followed by placement in long-term housing; case management offered on-site at primary study sites, transitional housing, and stable housing sites. Usual care participants received standard discharge planning from hospital social workers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalizations, hospital days, and emergency department visits measured using electronic surveillance, medical records, and interviews. Models were adjusted for baseline differences in demographics, insurance status, prior hospitalization or emergency department visit, human immunodeficiency virus infection, current use of alcohol or other drugs, mental health symptoms, and other factors. RESULTS: The analytic sample (n = 405 [n = 201 for the intervention group, n = 204 for the usual care group]) was 78% men and 78% African American, with a median duration of homelessness of 30 months. After 18 months, 73% of participants had at least 1 hospitalization or emergency department visit. Compared with the usual care group, the intervention group had unadjusted annualized mean reductions of 0.5 hospitalizations (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.2 to 0.2), 2.7 fewer hospital days (95% CI, -5.6 to 0.2), and 1.2 fewer emergency department visits (95% CI, -2.4 to 0.03). Adjusting for baseline covariates, compared with the usual care group, the intervention group had a relative reduction of 29% in hospitalizations (95% CI, 10% to 44%), 29% in hospital days (95% CI, 8% to 45%), and 24% in emergency department visits (95% CI, 3% to 40%). CONCLUSION: After adjustment, offering housing and case management to a population of homeless adults with chronic medical illnesses resulted in fewer hospital days and emergency department visits, compared with usual care.

STUDY DESIGN: Cluster RCT. SETTINGS/PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two CBOs located in Baltimore, Maryland, were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group, and 5,255 patients were allocated to the intervention or control group based on whether they lived closer to an intervention or control CBO. Data were collected in 2014-2016; the analysis was conducted in 2016. INTERVENTION: A multicomponent intervention included an online tool to help refer clients to community resources, meet-and-greet sessions between CBO staff and healthcare staff, and research assistants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were patient emergency department visits and days spent in the hospital. Additional outcomes for CBO clients included knowledge of other CBOs, number of referrals to CBOs by the healthcare system, and number of referrals to healthcare system by CBOs. Outcomes for CBO staff included the number of referrals made to and received from the healthcare system and the number of referrals made to and received from other CBOs. RESULTS: There was no significant effect of the intervention on healthcare utilization outcomes, CBO client outcomes, or CBO staff outcomes. Ancillary analyses demonstrated a 2.9% increase in referrals by inpatient staff to intervention CBOs (p=0.051) and a 6.6% increase in referrals by outpatient staff to intervention CBOs between baseline and follow-up (p=0.027). Outpatient staff reported a significant reduction in barriers related to the lack of information about CBO services (-18.3%, p=0.004) and an increase in confidence in community resources (+14.4%, p=0.023) from baseline to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention did not improve healthcare utilization outcomes but was associated with increased healthcare staff knowledge of, and confidence in, local CBOs.

Rideshare services have been proposed as alternatives to nonemergency medical transportation programs because of convenience and lower costs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between rideshare-based medical transportation and missed primary care appointments among Medicaid patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a prospective clinical trial, 786 Medicaid beneficiaries who resided in West Philadelphia and were established primary care patients at 1 of 2 academic internal medicine practices located within the same building were included. Participants were allocated to being offered complimentary ride-sharing services (intervention arm) or usual care (control arm) based on the prescheduled day of their primary care appointment reminder. Those scheduled on even-numbered weekdays were in the intervention arm and on odd-numbered weekdays, the control arm. The primary study outcome was the rate of missed appointments, estimated using an intent-to-treat approach. All individuals receiving a phone call reminder were included in the study sample, regardless of whether they answered their phone. The study was conducted between October 24, 2016, and April 20, 2017. INTERVENTIONS: A model of providing rideshare-based transportation was designed. As part of usual care, patients assigned to both arms received automated appointment phone call reminders. As part of the study protocol, patients assigned to both arms received up to 3 additional appointment reminder phone calls from research staff 2 days before their scheduled appointment. During these calls, patients in the intervention arm were offered a complimentary ridesharing service. Research staff prescheduled rides for those interested in the service. After their appointment, patients phoned research staff to initiate a return trip home. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Missed appointment rate (no shows and same-day cancellations) in the intervention compared with control arm. RESULTS: Of the 786 patients allocated to the intervention or control arm, 566 (72.0%) were women; mean (SD) age was 46.0. (12.5) years. Within the intervention arm, 85 among 288 (26.0%) participants who answered the phone call used ridesharing. The missed appointment rate was 36.5% (144 of 394) for the intervention arm and 36.7% (144 of 392) for the control arm (P = .96). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The uptake of ridesharing was low and did not decrease missed primary care appointments. Future studies trying to reduce missed appointments should explore alternative delivery models or targeting populations with stronger transportation needs.
